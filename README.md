## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: CLI Interface (Enhanced)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the enhanced CLI agent
python -m agent.main
```

### Option 2: Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Launch the Streamlit web interface
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## üéÆ How to Use

### Training Process

1. **Agent Suggests Action**: For each task, the agent analyzes the intent and suggests an action
2. **Next-Best Option**: The system also shows the second-best alternative
3. **Provide Feedback**: Use the intuitive feedback system:
   - üëç or `1`, `y`, `yes` for correct actions
   - üëé or `2`, `n`, `no` for incorrect actions
4. **Optional Corrections**: When providing negative feedback, suggest the correct action for bonus learning
5. **View Progress**: Real-time learning curves and performance metrics

### Web Interface Features

- **Interactive Training**: Point-and-click feedback system
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live learning curve updates
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Comprehensive performance metrics
- **Progress Tracking**: Episode-by-episode improvement monitoring
- **Export Capabilities**: Download logs and visualizations

## üìä Output & Analytics

### Generated Files

1. **Task Log** (`data/task_log.csv`)
   - Complete structured logs with all required fields
   - Task ID, Intent, Action, Reward, Timestamp, Confidence, Feedback
   
2. **Episode Log** (`data/episode_log.txt`)
   - Episode summaries with total rewards and timestamps
   
3. **Learning Visualizations**
   - `learning_curve.png`: Enhanced learning curve with trend analysis
   - `dashboard.png`: Multi-panel performance dashboard
   
4. **Q-Table Persistence** (`data/q_table.pkl`)
   - Saved learning state for continued training

### Sample Analytics

```
üìà Learning Progress Example:
Episode 1: Total Reward = 43
Episode 2: Total Reward = 53 (+23% improvement)
Episode 3: Total Reward = 58 (+35% overall improvement)
Average Reward: 51.3
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications

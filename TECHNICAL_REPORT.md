### 1.2 Core Components

#### Q-Learning Agent (`q_learning.py`)
- **State Space**: Parsed intents from natural language tasks
- **Action Space**: 7 predefined actions: `["open", "mute", "play", "unmute", "close", "screenshot", "set_dnd"]`
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate (Œ±): 0.2
  - Discount factor (Œ≥): 0.9
  - Exploration rate (Œµ): 0.2
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Next-best action suggestions
  - Action confidence scoring
  - Persistent Q-table storage

#### Feedback System (`feedback.py`)
- **Enhanced Interface**: Clear üëç/üëé visual feedback system
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Supports numeric (1/2), text (y/n/yes/no), and emoji inputs
- **Correction Mechanism**: Optional user suggestions for incorrect actions
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages

#### Logging System (`logger.py`)
- **Structured Format**: CSV-based logging with comprehensive fields
- **Required Fields**: Task ID, Parsed Intent, Action Taken, Reward, Timestamp, Confidence
- **Episode Tracking**: Separate episode-level reward aggregation

## 2. Reward Formula & Learning Mechanism

### 2.1 Reward Structure

The agent uses a sophisticated reward system designed to maximize learning efficiency:

```python
def calculate_reward(feedback, has_correction=False):
    base_rewards = {
        "üëç": +2,  # Correct action
        "üëé": -2   # Incorrect action
    }
    
    reward = base_rewards.get(feedback, 0)
    
    # Bonus reward for providing corrective feedback
    if feedback == "üëé" and has_correction:
        reward += 1  # Reduces penalty and encourages learning
    
    return reward
```

### 2.2 Q-Learning Update Formula

```
Q(s,a) ‚Üê Q(s,a) + Œ±[r + Œ≥ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

Where:
- `s`: Current state (parsed intent)
- `a`: Action taken
- `Œ±`: Learning rate (0.2)
- `r`: Immediate reward from user feedback
- `Œ≥`: Discount factor (0.9)
- `s'`: Next state
- `max Q(s',a')`: Maximum Q-value for next state

### 2.3 Exploration Strategy

The agent employs Œµ-greedy exploration:
- **Exploitation (80%)**: Select action with highest Q-value
- **Exploration (20%)**: Random action selection for discovery

## 3. Training Dataset

### 3.1 Task Diversity

The training dataset contains 30 realistic device control tasks spanning multiple categories:

**Categories Include**:
- Audio Control: "Mute audio", "Unmute audio", "Play music"
- Application Management: "Open calendar", "Close browser"
- System Operations: "Take screenshot", "Set DND"
- File Operations: "Open report.docx", "Open file manager"

### 3.2 Sample Tasks
```
09:00 AM - Open calendar
09:05 AM - Check Gmail
09:10 AM - Mute audio
09:15 AM - Take screenshot

```

## 4. Enhanced Features Implemented

```python
def get_next_best_action(self, state):
    """Returns second-highest Q-value action as alternative suggestion"""
    top_actions = self.top_actions(state, k=2)
    return top_actions[1][0] if len(top_actions) >= 2 else fallback
```

### 4.2 Confidence Scoring
```python
def get_action_confidence(self, state, action):
    """Normalized confidence score between 0 and 1"""
    # Based on Q-value relative to min/max for state
    confidence = (action_q - min_q) / (max_q - min_q)
    return round(confidence, 2)
```
